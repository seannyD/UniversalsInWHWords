\maketitle

This is a list of languages used in the main analyses.  It shows:
\begin{itemize}
\item the name of the language
\item the Glottolog and ISO identifier
\item the language family and area
\item the source of the word list
\item the position of interrogative phrases in the language
\item the source for the interrogative position data (WALS refers to \cite{wals-93})
\item the reference for the interrogative position data if not in WALS
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Coding interrogative position}
34 languages were coded by two coders (one of the authors, AS and and a naive coder, JP) according to the typology in \cite{wals-93}.  They agreed on 28 out of 34 languages (82\%).  A third coder (one of the authors, SR) blindly coded 6 random languages and agreed on all with both of the other coders (and cited the same grammars and page numbers as evidence).  The third coder then coded languages that the first two coders disagreed on (without knowing the coding decisions), and made an executive decision.  5 of the 6 decisions sided with AS.
